	symbol as a placeholder, don't mark it as used in a relocation
	entry, here.

	* Makefile.in (comparison): Compare as.new and gasp.new using
	makefile code from gcc, stripped down to discard subdir stuff and

	(indent_level): No longer static.
	(print_symbol_value_1): Don't print frag address if it matches

	expression-valued symbol, and calling fix_new_exp recursively.
	(adjust_reloc_syms): If a fixup's symbol value is a sum of an
	undefined symbol and a constant, fold the constant into the fixup,
	and refer to the undefined symbol directly.  Then process the

	through the symbol list trying to resolve values.

	* write.c (print_fixup): New routine, for debugging.

	involving global symbols too.

Mon Sep 19 12:12:46 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* as.h: Test NEED_DECLARATION_*, not NEED_*_DECLARATION.

	* configure.in: Test for remove, not delete.  Fix cross-assembler

	(bitfield_suffix, setup_basic_type): new routines.
	(VMS_typedef_parse): use them.  Now recognize bitfields of all
	integral types, not just type `int'.  Caveat:  the representation

	double', use `vax_g_doubles' flag to select type of double.
	(VMS_write_object_file) [traceback setup]: don't pass symbols
	with the IN_DEFAULT_SECTION attribute to the TBT_Routine_Begin
	and TBT_Routine_End functions.

	_C$MAIN_ARGS in advance, in case -h3 (leave symbol name as-is)
	gets requested.  [All the HACK_DEC_C_STARTUP code appears to
	be obsolete; gcc does it automatically for vms target.  It's
	also misnamed, because it is for the "VAX C" run-time library,
	not the newer "DEC C" one which has much different startup code.]
	{various}: use `S_SET_xxx(symbol,new_value)' rather than
	`S_GET_xxx(symbol) = new_value'.

Fri Jun  3 23:35:36 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* read.c (emit_expr): Use memset to zero out memory, rather than
	going through md_number_to_chars.  This permits handling symbolic
	arguments when the size is larger than sizeof (valueT), if
	TC_CONS_FIX_NEW is prepared to handle the case (as it is on MIPS).

Fri Jun  3 12:50:13 1994  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* as.c (show_usage), config/tc-alpha.c (md_show_usage),
	config/tc-mips.c (md_show_usage): Fix up messages.

	* as.h: Replace flagseen with separate variables.
	* as.c (parse_args): Set them.  Don't accept -1 option, or -v

	* config/tc-vax.c [OBJ_VMS]: Recognize -+, -1, -v, and document in
	usage.

	md_parse_option.  Remove md_parse_long_option.
	* config/tc-ns32k.c: Rename `struct option' to `struct ns32k_option'.
	* config/tc-i386.h: Don't define md_parse_option.

	m68040_control_regs, m68060_control_regs): New arrays.
	(control_regs): New pointer.
	(m68k_ip): Use control_regs instead of testing CPU every time.

	* config/obj-vms.c: Replaced unchecked uses of malloc with
	xmalloc.

	* listing.c (list_symbol_table): Only test BFD64, not
	BFD_ASSEMBLER too.

	* config/obj-vms.h (DBG_S_C_SQUAD, DBG_S_C_UQUAD): define these
	new VMS symbol-type macros; signed and unsigned quadword integers,
	for `long long' support.  Their values come from the existing
	DSC$K_DTYPE_QU and DSC$K_DTYPE_Q macros in <descrip.h>.  The
	VMS debugger now recognizes `long long' variables correctly.
	* config/obj-vms.c (VMS_typedef_parse) [case 'r']: add entries
	for gcc2's predefined types "long double" (same as double, as
	per gcc's current state), "long long int", "long long unsigned
	int", and final `otherwise' case (to avoid uninitialized type
	and size fields).  [caveat:  predefined types "complex int",
	"complex float", "complex double", and "complex long double" are
	still missing.]

	* config/ho-vms.h (EXIT_FAILURE): define as 0x10000002 instead
	of 0, because the latter indicates success rather than failure
	when passed to `exit' or return from `main' compiled by gcc2.

	* config/obj-vms.c (array_suffix, generate_suffix): replace two
	hardcoded `0xa3's with macro DBG_S_C_ADVANCED_TYPE from obj-vms.h.
	(VMS_typedef_parse): eliminate redundant if-then-else when
	allocating new symbol entry and linking it to VMS_Symbol_type_list.

	Tue May 17 20:47:31 1994  Pat Rankin  (rankin@eql.caltech.edu)

	* config/obj-vms.c (Write_VMS_MHD_Records): don't try to interpret
	the contents of the GAS_VERSION string when falling back to it for
	language processor identification.

	* make-gas.com, vmsconf.sh (ENVIRON): fix misspelling of
	`psect_attr' in linker options.

	* config/tc-hppa.c (pa_ip): Use R_HPPA_ABS_CALL, not R_HPPA for
	absolute calls.

Tue May 17 12:50:46 1994  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* config/tc-hppa.c (pa_parse_fp_cmp_cond): Report an error
	on a partial completer match.

Mon May 16 12:03:49 1994  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* config/tc-hppa.c: Change .hppa_unwind to .PARISC.unwind
	throughout code.
	(is_complex): Delete definition and support for complex relocation

Wed May  4 02:29:21 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* as.h (strstr): Restore declaration.
	(subseg_get) [BFD_ASSEMBLER]: Declare.

	* config/tc-m68k.c (DATA, ADDR, SP, FPREG, COPNUM, BAD, BAC):
	Define as macros instead of enumerators, since the Apollo compiler
	can't handle "enumVal1, enumVal2 = enumVal1" when defining an enum

	* configure.in: Set ALL_OBJ_DEPS in output Makefile.

	Based on suggestions from <BAILEY@hmivax.humgen.upenn.edu>

	* vmsconf.sh: In generated file, get ".obj" suffix right, build
	source files from other directories into objects in the current
	directory, and specify PSECT attributes explicitly to linker.
	Also added missing label.
	* Makefile.in (stamp-mk.com): Reference new variable
	VMS_OTHER_OBJS for list of non-local object files, instead of
	listing them here.
	(VMS_OTHER_OBJS): New variable, added more libiberty files.

	argument, the reloc type.
	(load_register): Pass reloc type to macro_build for 'u'.
	(macro): Likewise.  For M_LA_AB permit a difference expression
	when generating embedded PIC code between an arbitrary symbol and

	elf_tc_make_sections stuff.  It was there to support PA braindamage
	which has been fixed, and in the case of elf_tc_make_sections is
	redundant with elf_tc_final_processing.

Wed Apr  6 20:48:30 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* configure.in (hppa*-*-*elf*): Don't require "-hp-" for the

	targets, now explicitly checking $(srcdir) for info files.
	(install-info): Depend on both of them; do nothing more.

	* config/tc-ppc.c (ppc_insert_operand): Check PPC_OPERAND_SIGNED
	flag rather than signedp field.  Only permit extended range if
	PPC_OPERAND_SIGNOPT flag is set and assembling in 32 bit mode.
	Based on patch from David Edelsohn (edelsohn@npac.syr.edu).

	* config/tc-ppc.c (ppc_size): New static variable.

	* config/obj-coff.h (SEPARATE_STAB_SECTIONS): Always define.

Mon Mar 28 12:35:00 1994  David Edelsohn  (edelsohn@npac.syr.edu)

	* config/tc-ppc.c (md_parse_option): Add -mpwrx (POWER/2 aka
	RIOS2), -mpwr (POWER aka RIOS1), -mppc (PowerPC aka MPC603/604),

	N_INDR symbol, set BSF_EXPORT and clear BSF_LOCAL.

	* config/tc-mips.c (append_insn): If EMBEDDED_PIC, don't swap a
	branch with an instruction that uses $at, in case the branch is
	later expanded.
	(macro): If EMBEDDED_PIC, case M_JAL_A may use $at.
	(md_pcrel_from): If not OBJ_AOUT, return 4 for an undefined symbol
	to make it pcrel_offset.
	(tc_gen_reloc): If not OBJ_AOUT, set the reloc addend to
	reloc->address; another gruesome hack to get gas reloc handling to
	do the right thing.

Thu Mar 24 21:29:29 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-alpha.c (alpha_ip): Only set GP prolog size if using

	LITERAL reloc, cleared by anything that generates a LITUSE reloc,
	tested by code that might want to emit a LITUSE reloc.
	(emit_unaligned_io): New function.  Currently calls md_assemble,
	but it should eventually be converted to generate the insn itself
	and call emit_insn directly.
	(emit_load_unal, emit_store_unal, emit_byte_manip_r,
	emit_extract_r, emit_insert_r, emit_mask_r, emit_sign_extend,
	emit_bis_r): Likewise.

	* config/tc-mips.c (md_parse_option): For -membedded-pic, force
	the -G value to 0x7fffffff.  For SVR4 PIC options, don't call
	bfd_set_gp_size here, it's done in md_begin.  Don't permit -G with
	-membedded-pic.
	(mips_force_relocation): New function.

	(load_address): Handle EMBEDDED_PIC.
	(macro): Handle EMBEDDED_PIC in all PIC cases.
	(md_parse_option): Accept -membedded-pic to use EMBEDDED_PIC.  If
	OBJ_ELF, accept -KPIC and -call_shared to use SVR4_PIC and accept
	-non_shared to use NO_PIC (this is how the Irix 5 assembler
	works).  Do not permit -G with SVR4_PIC.
	(s_abicalls): Warn if -G was used, and force -G 0.
	(tc_gen_reloc): Set reloc->addend to 0 for a PC relative reloc for
	anything but a.out, not just for ELF.  For ECOFF, don't generate a
	BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL_S2 reloc unless using EMBEDDED_PIC.

	* config/obj-ecoff.h (obj_sec_sym_ok_for_reloc): Define to be 1.

Sun Mar 20 14:43:14 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (config-stamp): If `defs' is defined, emit a
	preprocessor directive to create a macro named by this value into
	config.new; don't explicitly go for BFD_ASSEMBLER.
	* configure.in: Define `defs', not `BFDDEF'.  Set it to
	MANY_SEGMENTS for any obj-coffbfd target.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h (BFD_HEADERS, BFD): Define.
	* config/i386coff.mt (TDEFINES): Don't define BFD, MANY_SEGMENTS,

	bfd_set_symtab is called.
	(dump_section_relocs): Note whether a symbol is a section symbol
	or not.
	(adjust_reloc_syms): For now, always supply an absolute symbol for
	fixups without symbols but not yet `done'.  Use section_symbol to
	get the symbol, instead of going directly for abs_symbol.
	(write_relocs) [DEBUG4]: Abort if any symbol referred to by a
	reloc is not a section symbol and is not in the symbol table.
	(set_symtab): New function, broken out from write_object_file.
	Counts symbol table instead of relying on an earlier count.
	(write_object_file): Call set_symtab, but do it after potentially
	invoking the *_frob_file macros.  Don't bother counting symbols.
	Call symbol_remove, instead of expanding it in place.  Moved the
	conditionalized `object_file_size' declaration down to
	conditionalized block where it's used.  When using the absolute
	symbol for a fixup without a symbol, set sy_used_in_reloc.
	(write_object_file) [BFD_ASSEMBLER]: Call section_symbol to get
	the correct symbol for the absolute section.

	* subsegs.c (section_symbol): Use symbol_new instead of
	symbol_make, since we may want it to go into the symbol table.
	Make the new symbol have internal linkage.  If
	obj_sec_sym_ok_for_reloc says it's okay, use the BFD section
	symbol with the newly created GAS symbol.
	(obj_sec_sym_ok_for_reloc): Default to always returning 0.
	* config/obj-aout.h (obj_sec_sym_ok_for_reloc) [BFD_ASSEMBLER]:

	(sparc_ip, label "immediate"): Reject constants for pcrel
	instructions only if the relocation type indicates a "call"
	instruction and the offset is within range of a "jmpl %g0".  If
	it's not in range, use the absolute section symbol plus an offset.
	(md_apply_fix): Use in_signed_range.  Combined _SPARC13 and
	_BASE13 cases.
	(tc_gen_reloc): Permit BFD_RELOC_SPARC13.

	* config/ic960coff.mt (TDEFINES): Fixed typo (MANY_SECTIONS, not
	MANY_SEGMENTS).

	* configure.in: Eliminated all targets using obj-coff but not
	defining BFD_ASSEMBLER; I think all such targets that are
	supported will be matched by real CPU-OS combinations earlier in
	the case statement.
	(targets *-*-coff*, *-sysv*, *-*-sco*, *-*-sysv32): Deleted.  Made
	some comments about the dpx2 configuration, but left it disabled,
	since it couldn't be reached before.
	(target a29k-amd-ebmonold): Deleted.

Thu Mar 17 13:36:09 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	already defined symbol.

Wed Mar 16 17:11:37 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-mips.c (mips_ip): Only accept overly large values for
	the 'j' operand if there are no further alternatives for this
	instruction.

	* config/obj-coffbfd.c (adjust_stab_section): Initialize
	stabstrseg to SEG_UNKNOWN, not -1.  After loop, check whether it
	is not SEG_UNKNOWN rather than checking whether it is >= 0.

	* config/tc-mips.c (mips_align): Take new argument, label, and use
	it instead of global insn_label.
	(s_align, s_cons, s_float_cons, s_gpword): Save insn_label before
	call to mips_emit_delay and pass it to mips_align.

        * config/tc-hppa.c (pa_equ): Handle both .reg and .equ correctly.

	* config/tc-hppa.c (pa_callinfo): Accept "millicode" as an
	argument to a .callinfo directive.  Don't loop forever on errors.

	field.  (Also from Holger Teutsch.)  Watch for a would-be register
	mask that spans frags.

	* config/obj-coffbfd.c (obj_coff_line): Set symbol lnno field with
	this_base, not line_base.  (Patch from Andreas Arens,
	ari@obelix.av.rwth-aachen.de.)

	* config/obj-aout.c (obj_crawl_symbol_chain): Retain symbols that
	look local if they're exported or undefined.  Used to be done for
	i960 only.

	Get it from the looked-up symbol, instead of using the string from
	the input stream, which is no longer null-terminated.

	(lex_type): Use it for `%'.

	* config/tc-vax.c (md_parse_option): Handle `-h#' option for VMS.

	(obj_pseudo_table): Make it available only if MANY_SECTIONS.
	(obj_symbol_to_chars) [CROSS_COMPILE]: Some attemps to make this
	work.  It still doesn't.  It now fails to compile, instead of

	MANY_SECTIONS.
	(OBJ_PROCESS_STAB) [! MANY_SECTIONS]: New macro, just emits

	OPTIONAL_REGISTER_PREFIX if either is already defined.

	* config/tc-m68k.c (m68k_ip): Delete some code in "#if 0".

	* configure.in: Set bfd_gas for all sparc targets.  Added facility
	for keeping or rejecting configurations still under development;
	default is to assume production environment, and reject configs
	still being worked on.  Mark Elf configurations (except sparc and
	i386) as developmental.  Deleted cases matching some generic names
	in favor of more specific names.  (E.g., when we get Alpha
	support, we'll still only support VMS for Vax.)

	* config/tc-sparc.h (md_end): New macro.
	* config/tc-sparc.c (md_end): Function deleted.
	(BFD_RELOC_*): Delete macros that used to help keep the non-bfd

	Changes from Jeff Law and Peter Hoogenboom:

	* read.c (next_char_of_string): Limit octal character constants to

	against placing additional object-file dependent code here.  Warn
	against contaminating all of GAS with the internals of tc-hppa.c
	through inclusion of tc-hppa.h.  Delete all forward declarations
	for functions only used within tc-hppa.c, likewise for structures,
	variables, and #defines.  Try to group OBJ_ELF and OBJ_SOM
	conditional code in a few small places.

	* config/tc-hppa.c: Major cleanup.  Use GNU-style comments.  Group
	structures, global variables, forward declarations together.
	Reduce (or in some cases eliminate) OBJ_ELF and OBJ_SOM
	conditional code -- try to group conditional code together
	into a few places.   Make all functions and variables which
	are only used within tc-hppa.c static.  PARAMize all functions.
	Add comments to functions.  Delete unused functions, variables,
	#defines, etc.  Delete unused members within structures.  Delete
	ldil;ble hacks -- it is believed they were installed to work
	around old gas bugs.   Avoid using mixed case for local
	functions, variables, and structures.  Fix formatting problems
	not found by GNU-indent.  Add FIXME notices for things which
	should be worked on the near future.  Delete lots of old
	useless (1.36 PA-SOM) code.  

	* config/tc-hppa.c: (fix_new_hppa): Initialize the fx_r_type
	field of the fixS structure.  Needed to build unwind

	which do not involve function symbols.

	* config/tc-hppa.h: Reindent with GNU-indent.  Delete references
	to OBJ_OSFROSE.  Fix typos (OBJ_SOME -> OBJ_SOM).  Delete unused
	STAB_FIXUP macro.
	* config/tc-hppa.c: Likewise.

	* config/tc-hppa.c (md_apply_fix_1): Use elf_symbol_type, instead
	of elf32_symbol_type.
	(pa_export_args): Likewise.
	(elf_hppa_final_processing): Likewise.
	(pa_desc): Do not call obj_elf_desc.  (Is pa_desc even needed
	anymore?)
	(hppa_tc_make_sections): Do not declare elf_get_symtab_map any
	ore.

	* config/tc-hppa.c: (md_section_align): Align all sections to
	a multiple of the section alignment rather than always a
	multiple of 8.

	* config/tc-hppa.c (hppa_tc_symbol): If the argument relocation
	bits are zero (eg they specify no relocations), then do not even
	bother adding their entries to thesymextn section.

	(pi, te, pt, pe, ps): Add declarations so that DEBUG386 can be
	used again.
	(reloc): Don't return 8 and 16 bit non-PC relative relocations on

	(md_assemble): Keep track of the instruction size.  Allow white
	space between the $ and the constant for compatibility with older
	gases and other assemblers.

	* expr.c (operand): If character other than comma or newline is a
	logical end-of-line character, use the newline case.
	From Eric Youngdale:
	(operand): Set X_add_number field for floating-point numbers.
	(operand): Treat zero byte as end-of-operand.

	* configure.in (per-target): Look for with_bfd_assembler option.
	For now, only accept "no", until the merge is done.

	Merged changes from Eric Youngdale (youngdale@v6550c.nrl.navy.mil):
	* as.c, flonum-konst.c, hex-value.c, input-file.c, version.c,
	  config/obj-aout.h, config/obj-vms.c: VMS -> HO_VMS.
	* read.c: Finish conversion to S_* macros in the VMS only
	  parts of the program. Add "const" modifier to hex_value.
	* as.c, read.c, symbols.c, write.c: Change "ifdef VMS" to
	  "ifdef OBJ_VMS".
	* expr.c: Add "const" modifier to hex_value.
	* symbols.c: Finish conversion to S_* macros in the VMS only
	  parts of the program.  Add "const" modifier to
	  md_[long,short]_jump_size. Remove declaration of const_flag
	  (which will be declared in obj-vms.h).
	* write.c: Add "const" modifier to md_[long,short]_jump_size.
	  Fix arguments to VMS_write_object_file.
	* config-gas.com: New file.  Script for VMS systems to set up the
	  configuration to build gas for VMS, and create config.status.
	* make-gas.com: Redone to work with new scheme.
	* obj-vms.c: Patch to fix bug where we were not correctly parsing the
	  stabs directives.
	* obj-vms.c:  Define macros COPY_LONG and COPY_SHORT which
	  will swap bytes if needed on a big endian system.  Use throughout
	  as needed.
	* obj-vms.c (obj_aout_stab):  Add code to generate listing file.
	* obj-vms.c (VMS_typedef_parse): Add alias to correctly handle certain
	  types of malformed stabs.  Change parsing algorithm so that we are
	  more certain of having all of the information that we need on hand.
	* obj-vms.c (final_forward_reference):  New function, used to help
	  resolve the data types of as many struct elements as possible
	  when some part of the struct is not fully defined by the compiler.
	* obj-vms.c (VMS_LSYM_Parse):  Correctly handle case of continuation
	  stabs directives.
	* obj-vms.c (VMS_write_object_file): Define all vtable psects
	  as symbols as well in the object file.  Look for external functions
	  that start with "__vt.", and turn them into variables, since the
	  g++ compiler is incapable of doing this.
	* tc-vax.c: Add '1' option for backward compatibility with older GCC
	  versions.
	* bignum-copy.c (bignum_copy): Fix bug where we pad with zeroes.
	* input-scrub.c (as_where): Fix bug where as would crash if we did not
	  have the name of the source file yet.

Mon Jan  4 05:17:26 1993  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cygnus.com)

	if these are used or defined, if BFD_ASSEMBLER.
	(subseg_set, subseg_new) [BFD_ASSEMBLER]: Functionality of old

	* as.h (volatile): Don't define if already defined.
	(had_errors, had_warnings): Provide prototypes for ANSI C even if
	NO_STDARG.
	(as_bad, as_fatal, as_tsktsk, as_warn): For GNU C version 2,
	declare with format attribute for -Wformat checking.

Wed Dec 30 10:18:57 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* app.c, config/tc-*.c: Don't include read.h, since it is already
	included by as.h.

	* These are based on patches from Minh Tran-le
	<mtranle@paris.intellicorp.com>.
	* configure.in (i[34]86-ibm-aix*): Accept i486 for host.  Use

	* config/obj-coffbfd.c (had_lineno, had_reloc): Removed.
	(size_section): Restored sanity check.
	(do_relocs_for): Base section address on s_paddr rather than
	computing it.  Adjust a29k R_IHIHALF special case to account for
	section paddr (used to require paddr to be zero).  If there are no
	reclos, set s_relptr to 0.  Set relocation size in object_headers.
	(fill_section): Always set s_vaddr here, removing
	ZERO_BASED_SEGMENTS case.  Force s_scnptr for bss to 0.  Don't set

	fill_section before do_relocs_for and do_linenos_for.
	(obj_coff_section): Handle optional quoted second argument giving
	section characteristics.
	(obj_coff_bss): Added to handle .bss.
	(obj_coff_ident): Added to handle .ident (puts string in .comment
	section).
	(obj_coff_lcomm): Put common symbols in .bss, not .data.
	(fixup_mdeps): Change to segment.  Call frag_wane after
	md_convert_frag.
	(fixup_segment): Explicitly check S_IS_COMMON before making 386
	adjustment (already happened only for common symbols, but this is
	clearer).
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h (OBJ_COFF_OMIT_OPTIONAL_HEADER): Define.

	never set segment address for SEG_E2 (.bss) and don't write out
	SEG_E2 contents.  Set .init and .fini sections to STYP_TEXT.
	(obj_coff_endef): Don't merge labels or symbols awaiting forward
	definitions, and don't merge tags with non-tags.  Check for .bf
	rather than just checking whether the second character is b and
	the third character is f.
	(obj_coff_val): gcc can generate values which we don't handle
	correctly; discard information for now, since it only affects the
	debugging information.
	(tag_find_or_name): Don't insert tags in the symbol table.
	(yank_symbols): Don't merge labels.
	(write_object_file): Don't define SUB_SEGMENT_ALIGN if it is

	* expr.c: If an expression is single comma, then return with
	SEG_ABSENT rather than an error - since the sparc front end does
	really strange things with things like fbge,a

	* as.h: include bfd.h if using many sections
	* expr.c: LOCAL_LABELS_FB had been changed to lower case - so
	local labels didn't work.
	* listing.c (list_symbol_table): don't core dump when there's no
	symbol there.
	* write.c, write.h: call fix_new with the right number of args on
	the H8.
	* config/tc-h8300.[ch] : fix bugs reported by HMSI, and make
	errors nices

Sat Feb 22 12:26:28 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* app.c: MRI compatibility - allow single quote to start a string.
	* as.c: fix typo recently introduced.
	* as.h : Don't include aout/reloc.h - it's not right for COFF!
	* expr.c: Much rewriting, to accomodate MRI syntax for
	expressions. Also easier to read now.
	* listing.c: Put back defuns
	* read.c: modified to accept MRI syntax, put back listing pseudo
	ops so that an assembler built with NO_LISTING ignores list ops
	rather than pukes.
	* write.c, write.h: fixs - only keep a reloc type in a fix if the target
	machine is a SPARC or a 29K.
	* config/obj-aout.c: added s_sect pseudo op
	* config/obj-coffbfd.c: lints, set the filehdr flags right and
	fill in the timestamp.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h: Since we don't include aout/reloc.h
	anymore, define all the relocs which the tc-<x> bit will use so we
	can translate from them to the coff types.
	* config/tc-a29k.c: reloc_type isn't ane enum any more
	* config/tc-m68k.c: Added NO_RELOC definition.

Fri Feb 21 06:21:07 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: put header files before C source for TAGS; remove
	  references to non-existent syscalls.h.

	* read.c, write.c subsegs.c: back out the .bss changes.

	* obj-aout.c: do not include stab.gnu.h if NO_LISTING.

	* tc-i860.c, a.out.gnu.h: move i860 relocs to a proper place.

	* a.out.h: removed.

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  Minh Tran-Le (TRANLE@INTELLICORP.COM)

	* symbols.c (local_label_name): symbols now start with ^A.

	* read.c, subsegs.c, write.c obj-coff.c: added handling of
	  `.bss` pseudo op for unitialized data. The new gcc (1.37.9x)
	  generate these sections.  .align: will use NOP_OPCODE or 0
	  for padding. This is just for being nice to the
	  disassembler.

	* expr.c (operand): changed to generate local label "\001L0"
	  starting with a ^A so that it is recognized as a local label.

	* as.c (perform_an_assembly_pass): zero bss_fix_root, too.

	* tc-i386.c: tc-i386.c: added handling of the following opcodes:
	  i/o opcodes - inb, inw, outb and outw.  string manipulation with
	  att syntax - scmp, slod, smov, ssca, ssto.

	* obj-coff.c: (for aix386) Moved the symbols .text, .data and .bss
	  to just after .file .

	  In obj_crawl_symbol_chain() where it tries to put the external
	  symbols apart, with the condition:
	    (!S_IS_DEFINED(symbolP) &&
	     !S_IS_DEBUG(symbolP) &&
	     !SF_GET_STATICS(symbolP))
	  it was moving too many symbols out. So I switch it back to the
	  condition:
	    (S_GET_STORAGE_CLASS(symbolP) == C_EXT && !SF_GET_FUNCTION(symbolP))

	  In obj_emit_relocations() added the conditional on KEEP_RELOC_INFO
	  so that we don't use the F_RELFLG which make the linker complain
	  that somebody has stripped the relocation info.

	  Also, the AIX ld program require that the relocation table
	  is sorted by r_vaddr like the standard ATT assembler does.

	  [he also changed the sizeof(struct ...)'s into the coff
	  style FOOSZ macros.  I'm not sure this is right, but I can't
	  remember why.  xoxorich.]

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, doc: use the doc.  Build it, install
	  it, clean it, etc.

Tue Feb 18 02:21:25 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* read.c: white space and comments only.

	* configure.in: use the new atof-ns32.c for ns32k.

	* write.c: comment change only.

	* tc-m88k.[hc]: pulled in from hack's unfinished work.  These
	  aren't yet integrated.

	* tc-i860.[hc]: blew off the dust.  Something must still be done
	  about conflicting relocation types.

	* tc-ns32k.c: Replaced previous tc_aout_fix_to_chars stub with the
	  real thing.

	* tc-i960.c, tc-sparc.c: white space and comments only.

	* tc-a29k.h: delete duplicate macro definition.

	* new file atof-ns32k.c copied from hack's last unreleased gas.

Mon Feb 17 07:51:06 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-ns32k.c: actually make tc_aout_fix_to_chars work
	  rather than abort.

	* nearly everything.  flush ChangeLog, package as gas-1.92.1.
	  ChangeLog's prior to this are sketchy at best.  I have logs.
	  They just aren't ChangeLogs.
